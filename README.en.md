# Silent Storm

*[Русский](README.md) | English*

The Silent Storm source code belongs to Nival; the original repository:
https://github.com/nival/Silent-Storm

This repository contains ongoing work on the source code, with the ultimate goal of
producing a behaviour-equivalent version of Silent Storm v1.2 by analyzing the
.pdb files of version v1.1 (RussianPatch1) and decompiling v1.2.

Status as of 2026-09-30: the Windows x64 game uses SDL3 for its window, keyboard
and mouse while retaining D3D9 rendering. The agreed Windows scope of stage 3
passed 170/170 tests and live menu, console and tutorial mission checks.
Linux game launch and joint Windows/Linux validation will accompany bgfx in
stage 4. The full campaign, complete Steam behaviour parity and macOS remain
unverified. See the [stage 3 report](diagnostics/SDL3-PLATFORM-WINDOWS.md)
for commands and limitations.

## Build

### Requirements
- **Windows** with **Visual Studio 2022** (requires the "Desktop development with
  C++" workload, MSVC v143, Windows SDK 10) or newer. Tested with VS 2026.
- **CMake 3.21+**
- The target game build is **Windows x64**.
- **SDL3 3.4.16**: development package containing `cmake/SDL3Config.cmake` and `SDL3.dll`.
- *Optional:* **DirectX SDK June 2010** (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) - only
  needed to build the `ShaderCompiler` tool; if it's not installed, the tool is
  skipped automatically.

### Building
Run **`build.bat`**, or execute the following in a terminal from the repository folder:

For `build.bat` and `build-debug.bat`, first set the `SDL3_DIR` environment
variable to the SDL3 3.4.16 package's `cmake` directory.

```
cmake -S . -B build -A x64 -DSDL3_DIR=G:/SS/lab/tools/sdl3-3.4.16/SDL3-3.4.16/cmake
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The results will appear in **`build\Release\`** - `Game.exe` and the tools
(`DataImport`, `PkgBuilder`, `FontGen`, `TexConv`, `TexMipStrip`, `ShaderCompiler`).

For debugging, run **`build-debug.bat`** (builds the `RelWithDebInfo` configuration),
open **`build\A5.sln`** in Visual Studio, and start debugging the `Game` project.
CMake will try to set your game folder as the debugger's working directory
automatically; if that fails, you'll need to set it manually: right-click the
`Game` project - Properties - Debugger - Working Directory. Example:
`E:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Silent Storm`

### Running the game
Use a separate copy of the game data, with `Game.exe`, `SDL3.dll` and the other
DLLs from your build. Preserve the original installation. The working directory
must contain `game.db`, `cfg` and the complete `res` directory. Laboratory runs
use `diagnostics/New-LabRun.ps1` and `Start-LabRun.ps1`.

The main game now uses SDL3 for its window, keyboard and mouse. Stage 3 is
validated on Windows with the existing D3D9 renderer; Linux launch and testing
will accompany the renderer migration in stage 4. Commands and evidence:
[SDL3-PLATFORM-WINDOWS.md](diagnostics/SDL3-PLATFORM-WINDOWS.md).

### Notes
- The imported proprietary libraries fmod / Bink / LifeStudio are **generated at
  build time** from the committed `.def` export tables in the `third_party/`
  directory - the original SDKs are not required.
- `MapEdit`, `Scintilla`, `OpenDynamix`, and `LSConverter` are kept in the
  repository but are **not built** (for various reasons - `MapEdit` in particular
  is quite complicated); their source file lists are preserved in `sources.cmake`.
